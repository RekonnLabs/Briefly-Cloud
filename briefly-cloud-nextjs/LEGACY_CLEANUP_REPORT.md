# Legacy Python Codebase Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-08-08T19:03:34.675Z
**Migration:** Python FastAPI + React → Unified Next.js

## Summary

This report documents the cleanup of legacy Python codebase components after migrating to a unified Next.js architecture.

## Archived Components

The following components have been moved to `legacy-python-backup/` for reference:

### Python Backend (`server/`)
- FastAPI application code
- Route handlers and middleware
- Utility functions and helpers
- Python requirements and configuration

### Railway Deployment (`railway_app/`)
- Railway-specific deployment configuration
- Environment setup files
- Railway deployment scripts

### Legacy Tests (`tests/`)
- Python-based integration tests
- API testing scripts
- Test data and fixtures

### React Client (`client/`)
- Vite-based React frontend
- Component library
- Build configuration

### Root Level Files
- `app.py` - Main FastAPI application
- `requirements*.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.env.railway` - Railway environment config

## Removed Components

The following items were safely deleted:

- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache
- `.dockerignore` - Docker ignore file (no longer needed)
- Legacy documentation files

## Updated Files

- `.gitignore` - Removed Python-specific entries, added Next.js entries
- `package.json` - Removed Python-related scripts

## New Architecture

The application now runs entirely on:
- **Frontend & Backend:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
- **AI:** OpenAI API integration

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, the archived components can be restored from `legacy-python-backup/`:

1. Copy desired components back to root directory
2. Restore Python environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Update environment variables for Railway deployment
4. Revert `.gitignore` changes if needed

## Notes

- All user data and functionality has been preserved in the new Next.js application
- API endpoints have been migrated to Next.js API routes
- Database schema remains compatible
- Environment variables have been updated for Vercel deployment
