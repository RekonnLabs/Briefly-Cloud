Briefly Cloud Test Document

This is a sample document for testing the Briefly Cloud MVP functionality.

Key Features:
- Cloud storage integration with Google Drive and OneDrive
- AI-powered document indexing and search
- Subscription tier management (Free, Pro, Pro BYOK)
- Real-time chat with document context

Technical Architecture:
The system uses FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and Supabase for authentication and data storage. Documents are processed using sentence transformers for embedding generation and stored in ChromaDB for vector search.

Test Scenarios:
1. User authentication and registration
2. Cloud storage OAuth connection
3. Document indexing and embedding
4. AI chat with context retrieval
5. Subscription tier enforcement

Expected Results:
Users should be able to connect their cloud storage, index their documents, and chat with an AI assistant that can answer questions based on their document content. The system should respect subscription limits and provide appropriate error handling.

Sample Questions to Test:
- What are the key features of Briefly Cloud?
- How does the technical architecture work?
- What test scenarios should be verified?
- What are the expected results?

This document contains enough content to test the chunking, embedding, and retrieval functionality of the system.
